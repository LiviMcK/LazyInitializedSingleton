# LazyInitializedSingleton

* I was able to create 3 threads and start them.
* The singleton hash code came up with the same number each time,
* I am not sure if it was supposed to happen that way but
* I am assuming it was because it was accessing the same Singleton instance 
* due to the getInstance method.
